======================
Upgrade Controller
======================

This controller handles the logic of adding the upgrade's effects once an upgrade
is appended to a player's inventory. The effects of each upgrade are pulled from game stats.

Important Notes
-----------------
This controller is automatically called from the engine at the end of each turn, so
the player does not need to perform any additional actions.
