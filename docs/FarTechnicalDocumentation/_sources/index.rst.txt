Welcome to FarTech's documentation!
=======================================

In this game you write the solider AI for a warmongering robot nation state. Your goal is to win as many 1v1 matches against 
other AI's, lest your robot employers find you to be incompetent at your job. Move, shoot, teleport, buy and throw grenades to
secure victory for Amazon ( no relation to the forrest ).
