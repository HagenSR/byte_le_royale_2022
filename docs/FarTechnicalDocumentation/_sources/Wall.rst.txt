Wall
=====

Lore
------------------
After countless cycles of non-stop conflict, this once beautiful, high-tech civilization has become a husk
of its former self. It's a miracle that a few of these once miraculer structures still stand today- as dilapidated as they are.
While these buildings may have been reduced to clusters of walls, they may still provide a protective barrier between you and your foe- at least while they can still
withstand the blows.


No one can hide forever...

Basic Info
------------------
The Wall is an object that will spawn in one of the map's nine subplots (see map documentation for more info).
Walls are collidable objects, meaning that a shooter object will cease movement if they run into it.
These walls can be damaged and even destroyed by bullets and grenades.
