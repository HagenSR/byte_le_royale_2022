Picking up Money
------------------
In order to pick up money, your shooter object must be standing on top of it. You can then
use this command to let the game know you would like to interact with this object.

    **Note: Each player can only perform up to 1 action per turn.**
.. code-block:: python
    actions.set_action(ActionType.interact)





Checking how much Money you Have

During the game, you'll probably want to keep track of
how much money you've been saving. To do so, you may enter the
following command:

.. code-block:: python
    shooter.money

This will return the money amount as an int value.
