Consumables
===============

Lore
------

Robots picked up their habit of consumption from the humans they replaced. This consumption is purely performative, as robot's are not actually affected by the items
they consume. All of these buffs latently exist within the robots capabilities, but they choose not to use them without consuming. This finicky behavior is a side effect
of creating AI based off of humans.
