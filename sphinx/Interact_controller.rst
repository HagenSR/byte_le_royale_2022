======================
Interact Controller
======================



Basic Info
-----------------

This controller allows you to interact with an object on the game board. The objects shooters can interact with are
consumables, upgrades, money, and doors.
**NOTE: Items have higher precedence than doors in the interact controller. If
you want to interact with a door, make sure you are not standing on an item before ending your
turn.**


Picking up Items
------------------

Shooters are able to pick up items by standing over them and setting their action to interact.

Opening/Closing Doors
----------------------

To open or close a door, the middle coordinates of the shooter hitbox must be within a distance of 10 units
from the door. Once doors are within range, the interact controller will then interact with the closest door.

Example Code
-------------

.. code-block:: python

    actions.set_action(ActionType.interact)
