====================
Shoot Controller
====================

The shoot controller handles how the player shoots, in other words, ray logic. When a player shoots it instantaneously sends a ray (or rays in the case of a gun shooting multiple times in a single shot) damaging whatever the rays come into contact with.
**If a player has a shield, it absorbs the damage of a single bullet.**
A gun has three types of shooting types. Single shot, where the user fires a single ray. Multi-shot where the user fires a quick succession of rays. The final type is spread, which acts like a shotgun.
