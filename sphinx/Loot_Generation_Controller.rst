Loot Generation Controller

Lore
----

There he stood, standing there, menacingly. The black sky smelled of mildew,
out of your left ear you hear a crow shrieking. It's been years since you stood in
front of another person, you think to yourself, "is that even a person?"
Suddenly the figure reaches down and sprints,
you find a gun to your head and the now apparent
animatronic asking you if you have heard about your cars extended warranty.
You didn't know, last time you drove 4 months ago was without insurance and
well, you needed insurance to have a car and if you didn't have insurance
the warranty surely must have expired right? Replying to the animatronic you
exclaim "uh, I don't know there was uh I.. I.." The animatronic had no time
for your senseless quarrel, you thought you were a goner.
UNTIL FROM THE SKIES CAME JOOOHHHNNN CEEEEEENNNNAAAA with his iconic
theme song playing
\" ba ba da ba bah da ba bah.\"
All of a sudden John Cena appears everywhere around you simultaneously.
There it is! A healthpack, you can now heal yourself and get out of here!



How it works
------------

The loot generation controller handles the spawning of loot around the
game map. Money has a 60% chance to spawn, guns 20% and upgrades 20%.
Loot is distributed according to a standard distribution,
centered at the middle of the game map. Before the spawning of a new loot wave,
all of the loot will be removed.
Allowing for higher-tier loot to appear as the game progresses.
