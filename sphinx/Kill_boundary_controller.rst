=====================
 The Kill Boundary 
=====================

Lore
---------------

A long time ago, two AI competitors realized the only winning move was to not 'play' this game of war. This of course was unacceptable to our Robot overlords, who promptly
Obliterated both AI's. To Prevent future stalemates, A safe zone was introduced. Essentially, this zone shrinks towards the center of the game board until it pops out of
existence. Needless to say, it is not safe to be outside the safe zone.

Notes on the Kill boundary
-----------------------------

The safe zone (inverse of the kill boundary) is a circle with a defined radius that shrinks. For the first 25 turns of the game, the safe zone covers the entire board.
After this period, The circle radius shrinks by 5 units every tick. Those outside the safe zone will take 20 damage every turn. Determination of who is in or out of the 
safe zone is decided by the middle of their Hitbox.
